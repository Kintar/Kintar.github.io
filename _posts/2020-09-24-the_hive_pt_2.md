# Getting Started
If you want to follow along, I've set up a project for milestone #1 [here](https://gitlab.com/infinities-within-gamedev/the-hive).

As of last night, all it really does is open a window and draw a runtime-created triangle sprite on the screen.  That's a good start, and it was REALLY simple to do.  I used [github.com/fogleman/gg](https://github.com/fogleman/gg) to draw the sprite, and settled on [Pixel](github.com/faiface/pixel/) for the 2d engine.  It was all pretty straightforward so far.

# Cross-compiling
The biggest issue I've hit so far is that I can't cross-compile a Windows executable from a non-windows platform, and I can't build a darwin (Mac OSX) image from a non-mac platform.  This is troubling, because a large part of Go's appeal is the fact that you get cross-compliation baked in from the beginning.  This looks to be a limitation with Pixel, or more specifically the go-gl rendering backend, since it uses CGO to access the OpenGL API.

# The Windows Solution
A brief trip into Google-space revealed a solution for this issue, at least for producing Windows binaries from Linux and Mac: I can just use the mingw-w64 compiler.  That means I have to update my build images.

## Build Images?
Since I'm a cloud-first developer in my day job, continuous integration and delivery are a huge part of my development lifecycle.  I try not to break that mentality when working on personal projects.  To that end, I maintain a (very) small list of Dockerfiles over at [this repo](https://gitlab.com/kintar1900/build-tools) which contain build systems for the languages I'm using in my projects, and automatically push those images up to a private docker repo when I change something.  Then I can use GitLab's top-notch CI system to build everything in the cloud.  The docker file for my Go image is pretty tiny:
```yaml
FROM golang:1.15.2

RUN apt update && apt install -y zip upx awscli mingw-w64
```
This just takes the base GoLang image provided by Google and adds a few utilities to it.  I've appended the MinGW compiler, so now it's just a matter of updating the image I'm using to build, and add the following prelude to the build command:
```
CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=1
```

Well, the Windows build worked:
```
$ CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o thehive.exe .
go: downloading github.com/faiface/pixel v0.10.0

go: downloading github.com/golang/freetype v0.0.0-20170609003504-e2365dfdc4a0
```
But now the Linux build is failing:
```
# github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.3/glfw
In file included from ./glfw/src/internal.h:187,
                 from ./glfw/src/context.c:30,

 #include <X11/Xlib.h>
          ^~~~~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
```
Looks like I forgot to check that the X11 development packages were installed on my build image.

...

Nope, also need the OpenGL dev libraries.  At this point, I'm just going to take the nuclear option and install `freeglut3-dev`, which should pull in absolutely ANYTHING OpenGL-related.

...

Well, I did say it was the "nuclear" option.  My image is 1.88GB now.  Holy crap.
```

But, it builds!  Milestone one complete!
