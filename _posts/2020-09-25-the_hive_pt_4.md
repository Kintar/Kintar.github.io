Well, I fell down a rabbit hole.  In this case, however, it's more like a sudden sinkhole.

I forgot that in using a very basic game library, I have given up having a scene graph structure already built.  Compounding that with a need to build some kind of ECS, I've caught myself in a chicken-and-egg problem that I'm going to have to solve before I move forward.  So, I'm going to use this blog as a place to rubber-duck my ideas.

# Why a scene graph?
A scene graph is an incredibly useful data structure for a game.  Having a hierarchial transform system potentially saves a lot of math and update calls.  And as I type this it occurs to me that it has another useful feature in that it removes the need for a whole class of component systems.  Let's see...
```go
type SceneNode struct {
	Transform pixel.Matrix
	Bounds pixel.Rect
	Parent *SceneNode
	Children []*SceneNode
}
```
