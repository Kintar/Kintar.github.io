# The Beginning...again
2020 is almost over and I haven't blogged since 2017.  I guess it's time!

# The state of my code
In the past several months, I've become infatuated with the [Go programming language](https://www.golang.org).  It's a modern language, so it shares a lot of DNA with C# and Java, the two languages I know best, but it's also designed to be fast, fast, fast.  That's not hyperbole, that's a three-pronged descriptor: fast to develop, fast to compile, fast to execute.  And even though Go is a garbage-collected language, there's no VM to install an it compiles directly to executable binaries instead of MIL or bytecode, which makes it wonderful for cloud-based deployment, the paradigm I've been working in professionally for the last several years.

# Project Ideas
I've learned a good deal about Go from my day job, but since we're mainly a Java shop, opportunities to expand that expose are limited.  As always, I have a bunch of hobbies and side-projects I'd like to work on, so it makes sense to take one or two of those and start implementing them in go.  That's also impetus to start blogging about code, so let's see what we have to choose from.

## Procedural Mapping
I've been fascinated by [Here Dragons Abound](https://heredragonsabound.blogspot.com) ever since Scott Turner started posting about it back in 2016, but I've never acually mustered the gumption to go and implement it myself.  I threw together a couple of example projects to get familiar with Go's image package and some of the higher-level drawing libraries I found [lying](https://github.com/fogleman/gg) [around](https://github.com/llgcode/draw2d), and it seems quite doable.  The main issue here is that Mr. Turner has done such a great job on his blog that I'm not sure there are any areas I'd want to modify as I port the code, so I don't know that it would hold my interest.

## Discord Bot
I play Elite: Dangerous every now and then, and I'm a member of a relatively active squad.  I started putting together a bot and AWS-powered backend to track fleet carrier movements when I first started playing with Go.  It's 80% complete but the squad doesn't seem terribly interested in using it, so my ability to test it in the wild is limited.

I'm probably not going to work on this much more until I get some definitive direction from the squad, but if anyone wants to make their eyes bleed by reading the code I was writing as literally my first attempt at Go, here's the source:
*  [Bot](https://gitlab.com/kintar1900/astropath-bot)
*  [Beacon](https://gitlab.com/kintar1900/astropath-bot)
*  [API](https://gitlab.com/kintar1900/astropath-api)
*  [Journal Parser](https://gitlab.com/kintar1900/ed-journal)

## Machine Learning
I've played with neural networks in the (far distant) past in C# and Java.  Go's extra speed and relatively first-class support for [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) makes it a good candidate to use when I pick the torch up again.

## Games
Game development is always a fun way to learn a language.  Scope creep is always a killer in this arena, though, as I never can manage to stick to my development roadmap, and get constantly distracted with rabbit holes of "oooh, that's a neat problem to try and solve!" code.  Still, there are quite a few [Go](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) [game](https://github.com/g3n/engine) [frameworks](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) lying around the internet.  Maybe this would be a good direction.

# Decision
After typing all of that up and thinking it through, I have an idea and a direction.  I'm going to write a 2d game that incorporates machine learning into the concept.  My next post will outline what I plan to do and lay down a roadmap.  Hopefully the act of putting it out on the internet will hold me to my plan.
