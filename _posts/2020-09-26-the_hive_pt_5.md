I am seriously loathing Go's lack of generics right now.  Looking at it as objectively as I can, however, I think it's just the force of old habits.  So, once more to the blog to "talk through" my issue.

# The Problem

For an ECS to work, the systems need to be able to query the component manager for all entities that have certain components attached.  The systems also need to be able to pull a reference to those components.  Since the components are the things that store and allow access to data, they need to be strongly-typed.  In Java or C#, I'd implement it something like this:

```java
public interface ComponentManager {
    <T> ICollection<Entity> getEntitiesWithComponent(Class<T> componentType);
}
```

And then the entities would also expose something like:
```java
public interface Entity {
    T GetComponent<T>();
}
```

That's not possible in Go, however.  Go's interface methodology is about duck typing instead of relying on type definitions.  That means we probably need to define a `ComponentType` to use as our marker for distinct components.  It can be as simple as an integer type.

The next issue is how to generalize creating, storing, and retrieving components for an entity. Entities are simple enough, they're _definitely_ just numeric values.

```go
type Entity uint64
type ComponentType uint64

type ComponentManager interface {
    SetComponentType(ComponentType)
    AddToEntity(Entity)
    RemoveFromEntity(Entity)
}

type EntityManager interface {
    RegisterComponentManager(ComponentManager)
    CreateEntity() Entity
    DestroyEntity(Entity)
    ComponentsForEntity(Entity) []ComponentType
    EntitiesWithComponents(types... ComponentType) []Entity
}
```
Then it's up to the individual component managers to provide a way to retrieve the component structure.

I think this is viable.  Let's try to get it implemented.
