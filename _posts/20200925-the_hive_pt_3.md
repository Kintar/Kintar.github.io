[The gitlab project](https://gitlab.com/infinities-within-gamedev/the-hive) has had a couple of updates with things I did early this morning while waiting for cloudformation stacks to deploy at work.  I have a basic map data structure and learned how to perform camera movement in Pixel.  I also collapsed all of the commits into a single commit, because I don't want any evidence of the stupidity involved in getting to that point. :sheepish grin:

Problem is, the code is really ugly, and is going to get ulgier _fast_.  I'm going to have to spend some time organizing things, and that's not exactly on the roadmap.  Is this a rabbit-hole, or a valid concern?

...

I spent a few hours chewing on that, and I think it's valid.  I'm going to need some kind of [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) eventually, and that pattern tends to lend itself nicely to neatly packaged code.  There are a surprising number of ECS libraries availavble for Go, but I'm not sure that's necessary.  It feels like swatting a fly with a cannon ball, so I'm going to roll my own very basic model.  All it really needs is a way to define a component, a component update function, and an entity manager for creating and querynig game objects.  I'll see if I can knock that out in an hour or two over the course of the evening.
